Please implement a new feature on the Car Creation page to allow users to select the vehicle's viewing angle before generating the image. This should override the default angle wording in the prompt templates.

---

âœ… OBJECTIVE

Allow the user to choose a "Car Angle" via a dropdown. This will inject a new variable into the existing prompt system (`|CAR_ANGLE|`). If no angle is selected, the current default prompt values should remain unchanged.

---

ðŸ§© FRONTEND CHANGES (CarCreationPage.tsx)

1. Update the `carGenerationSchema` to include:
   ```ts
   car_angle: z.string().optional()
2. Add a new dropdown to the form UI:

Label: "Car Angle"

Options (value â†’ label):

"" â†’ Default (35Â° front-left)

"directly facing the camera in a symmetrical front view" â†’ Front view

"at a 35-degree front three-quarter angle showing the front grille and right side" â†’ Front 3/4 right

"at a 45-degree rear three-quarter angle showcasing the taillights and left side" â†’ Rear 3/4 left

"in a perfect side profile view showing the full length of the car from the left" â†’ Left side profile

"captured from a high rear-top angle emphasizing the roofline and rear details" â†’ Rear aerial view

The default selected value should be "".

ðŸ§  BACKEND CHANGES (server/routes.ts)

3. Add car_angle to the destructured form data.

4. Update both prompt templates:

- In the hub/studio background template, replace the current sentence:
"The vehicle is positioned at a precise 35-degree angle showing the front grille, headlights with signature lighting illuminated, and right side profile."
with:
"The vehicle is positioned |CAR_ANGLE|."

- In the white background template, replace:
"camera 35Â° front-left, vehicle nose points left."
with:
"|CAR_ANGLE|."

5. Modify the prompt-building logic (after substitution of other variables) to include:
const carAngleDefault = (background === "hub")
  ? "at a precise 35-degree angle showing the front grille, headlights with signature lighting illuminated, and right side profile"
  : "camera 35Â° front-left, vehicle nose points left";

prompt = prompt.replace("|CAR_ANGLE|", car_angle?.trim() || carAngleDefault);


ðŸ“Œ DO NOT modify any batch processing logic yet (CSV, buildPrompt, etc.) â€” this change applies only to the single image generation flow.

Let me know once this is implemented and Iâ€™ll help verify angle substitutions and prompt outputs
