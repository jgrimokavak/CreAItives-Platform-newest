# Context  
You're working inside the CreAItives Platform project on Replit.  
The user has already created and downloaded a Google Cloud service account key (JSON format).  
This key has the necessary permissions (`Vertex AI User` and `Storage Object Admin`) to generate videos via Vertex AI and save them to Cloud Storage.  

Your task is to prepare the project to use that service account by creating the right folder structure, setting environment variables, and installing required dependencies.

# Objective  
Set up the environment so the backend can authenticate using the service account key to access Google Cloud APIs.

# Tasks

## 1. Create credentials folder  
Create a new folder in the root of the project named:  
```
credentials
```
This folder will store the JSON service account key file.

## 2. Update .env file  
Ensure there's a `.env` file in the root of the project.  
If it doesn't exist, create it.  
Add the following variables:

```env
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./credentials/video-generator-key.json
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=mkt-ai-content-generation
GCP_LOCATION=northamerica-south1
GCS_BUCKET=mkt_ai_content_generation
VEO_MODEL_ID=veo-3.0-generate-preview
```

Make sure the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path matches where the user will upload the JSON key file.

## 3. Install required dependencies  
Install the following NPM packages:

```bash
npm install @google-cloud/aiplatform @google-cloud/storage
```

These are required to interact with Vertex AI and Google Cloud Storage.

# Final Instruction to User  
Once you've completed the steps above, clearly tell the user the following:

- ✅ Upload your downloaded service account JSON file to:  
  `./credentials/video-generator-key.json`  
- ✅ Make sure the filename exactly matches what is referenced in the `.env` file.  
- ✅ Do not push this file to GitHub or version control.  

No API calls or backend logic should be added yet. This step is only about environment setup.
