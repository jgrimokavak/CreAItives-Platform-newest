## 📣 Replit Agent Task — Upgrade Storage Dashboard & Fix Crash
The **Storage Management** section (`/admin/storage`) is live but needs four new features plus a crash fix.

---

### 1 · Access-Control Audit  
Guarantee that only admins can access any storage-management UI or API.

* Re-use existing `AdminRoute` / auth-guard middleware.  
* Hitting `/admin/storage` or any `/api/admin/*` route in an incognito session must return **401/403**.  
* Add `/api/admin/storage/self-test` that returns `{ ok: true }` only when the admin guard passes.  
* Log every unauthorized attempt (IP, timestamp, path).

---

### 2 · Data-Accuracy Verification  
Add a “Verify Now” button that compares dashboard stats to live bucket data.

* **Backend route:** `GET /api/admin/storage/verify`  
  * Uses `client.list()` to count objects and sum sizes by environment (`dev/`, `prod/`).  
  * Returns the real numbers plus any diff vs currently cached values.  
* **Frontend:**  
  * Button in the Dashboard tab triggers the route.  
  * Show green badge “Last verified: <timestamp>” on match; red badge with diff on mismatch.

---

### 3 · Graph UX Polish  
Improve the Daily Upload Activity chart.

* Add hover **tooltips** (date + count).  
* Add date-range selector: **7 d · 30 d · 90 d** (default 30 d).  
* Keep existing chart library; no heavy new deps.

---

### 4 · Prod vs Dev Toggle  
Allow quick filtering of all stats and tables.

* Segmented control (Both · Dev · Prod) in dashboard header.  
* Filtering logic: object keys starting with `dev/` or `prod/`.  
* All metrics, tables, and chart re-query without full page reload (default = Both).

---

### 🐞  Crash Fix — Object Management Tab  
Current error:
Uncaught Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.

* Ensure every `<Select.Item>` has a non-empty `value`.  
* Provide default placeholder value for the `<Select.Root>`.  
* Eliminate WebSocket fallback warning (`wss://localhost:undefined`) by guarding the fallback URL builder.

---

### Constraints
* **Do not break** existing generation, gallery, or thumbnail flows.  
* All new code remains behind the admin guard.  
* New API endpoints live under `/api/admin/storage/*`.  
* Add concise console logs; remove noisy debug prints.
