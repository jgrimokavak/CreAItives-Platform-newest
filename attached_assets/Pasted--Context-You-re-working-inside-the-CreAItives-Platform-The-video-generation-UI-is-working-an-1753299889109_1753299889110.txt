# Context  
You're working inside the CreAItives Platform.  
The video generation UI is working and renders properly, but the actual video generation is not behaving as expected.

The backend is set up to use Google Vertex AI (Veo 3 and Veo 2), and credentials are already configured with access to Cloud Storage. However, the user is seeing the following issues:

# Observed Problems
- Pressing "Generate Video" triggers the UI, but after a short delay (3 seconds), "Session Results" appears with **empty video thumbnails or placeholders**
- It is unclear whether the backend is actually calling the Vertex AI API
- The generated video is not being rendered, and may not exist
- The videos are not showing as being part of a "Project" — even when a project is selected, the results appear only under “Session Results”

# Objective  
Run a full diagnostic on the video generation workflow and fix any problems.

---

# Diagnostic Tasks

## 1. Verify the `/api/video-generate` route
- Confirm that the route actually sends a `predictLongRunning` request to Vertex AI
- Log and return the `operationName`, and ensure the GCS `storageUri` is set properly
- Check if the generation job is being awaited correctly, or if the system returns too early

## 2. Check Vertex API logs
- If possible, print logs or add temporary logging to confirm that a real job is submitted
- Confirm that the request includes the expected prompt and model parameters

## 3. Check polling or WebSocket logic (if any)
- Is the frontend waiting for the video generation to finish before showing results?
- If not, implement polling or use a background task to check the final status

## 4. Confirm GCS Storage output
- Ensure that the generation request includes a valid `storageUri` (e.g., `gs://mkt_ai_content_generation/videos/<uuid>/`)
- If the folder exists in GCS, confirm that `.mp4` files are saved correctly

# Fixes to Implement

## ✅ Backend
- Ensure `startVertexVideoJob()` returns the full operation name and expected storage path
- Ensure the frontend or server waits until status = `succeeded` before rendering

## ✅ Frontend
- If possible, connect Session Results to real DB results or polling logic
- Add fallback or error UI if generation fails silently
- (optional) Show loading or job ID during processing

# Project Organization Fix
- The user wants to group video generations by **project**
- Add logic to associate each generated video with the currently selected project
- Reflect that in both DB and UI: instead of flat “Session Results,” group by project name or ID
- Add a way to see past projects and their videos (mini-gallery per project)

---

# Deliverable

- Fix video generation flow: video is created, stored in GCS, and rendered in UI
- Associate each video with its selected project
- Confirm logs show that Vertex API was called with the right data
- Make UI wait until job is finished (don’t render empty cards)

Once done, provide instructions on how to verify in Google Cloud whether the jobs were submitted (via Media Studio → History or GCS bucket).
