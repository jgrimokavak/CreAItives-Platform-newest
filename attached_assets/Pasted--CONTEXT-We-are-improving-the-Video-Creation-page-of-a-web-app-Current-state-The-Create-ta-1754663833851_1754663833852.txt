# CONTEXT
We are improving the **Video Creation** page of a web app.
Current state:
The Create tab currently uses a 2-column layout:
Left: generation form
Right: project panel with videos for the selected project
Bottom: Result panel showing the most recently generated video
A Job Tray at the bottom tracks video generation progress in real time
The Gallery tab organizes videos into collapsible groups per project (plus Unassigned) with drag-and-drop, filters, and bulk actions.
All videos are displayed using the `VideoCard` component (inline playback, Delete, Move).
Goal for this step:
Add an **optional “Power Mode” view** that switches the Create tab to a **3-pane layout**:
Left: generation form + presets
Center: “Canvas” — a large, focused viewer for previews, comparisons, and version history
Right: project panel listing videos for the selected project

# BEFORE STARTING
Run type-check and start the dev server. 
   Fix any errors before continuing.
Ensure:
All current Create tab features work (form, Result panel, Job Tray).
The app can store a UI mode toggle in component state or local storage.

# TASK: Add a Power Mode toggle with a 3-pane layout
## 1. UI mode toggle
Add a **“Mode”** toggle button in the Create tab header:
“Standard” → current 2-column layout
“Power Mode” → new 3-pane layout
Store the mode in component state and persist to local storage so it’s remembered across sessions.
## 2. Layout in Power Mode
When Power Mode is active:
**Left pane** (lg: span 3):
Generation form (prompt, model, resolution, duration, AI Enhance, etc.)
Add a **Presets** section below the form:
Dropdown of saved presets (name + model + resolution)
Buttons: “Save current as preset” and “Update preset”
**Center pane** (lg: span 6):
**Canvas viewer**:
Large video player for the currently selected video (inline playback)
If a video has multiple versions (e.g., retries with the same prompt), display them as a horizontal strip below the player — clicking a version updates the main preview
Optional side-by-side comparison mode: two videos with independent play/pause buttons
**Right pane** (lg: span 3):
Project panel listing videos for the selected project using `VideoCard`
Maintain filters and drag-and-drop in this panel as in Standard mode
## 3. Canvas integration
Selecting a video in:
Project panel (right)
Result panel
Job Tray
  …should set it as the active video in the Canvas.
If the active video changes, preload its metadata and thumbnail before switching.
## 4. Responsive behavior
On mobile/tablet:
Collapse into a single column with a top-bar “Switch Pane” control to navigate between Form, Canvas, and Project list.

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
A “Mode” toggle exists in the Create tab header to switch between Standard and Power Mode.
Power Mode uses a 3-pane layout with:
Left: form + presets
Center: large Canvas viewer with version strip and optional compare view
Right: project panel with `VideoCard` list
Selecting a video anywhere updates the Canvas preview.
Mode preference is remembered across sessions.
All existing features (Result panel, Job Tray, Delete/Move, drag-and-drop) still work in Power Mode.
