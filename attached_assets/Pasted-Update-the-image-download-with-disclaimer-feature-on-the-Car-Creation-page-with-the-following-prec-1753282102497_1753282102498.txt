Update the image download (with disclaimer) feature on the Car Creation page with the following precise design and behavior:

---

üîπ Aspect Ratio & Resolution:
- Crop the generated image to an exact **aspect ratio of 1.71:1**
- The **final image resolution must be exactly 1280 √ó 748 pixels**
- Do not compress, scale down, or lower quality ‚Äî the final image must preserve full visual sharpness at 1280√ó748

---

üîπ Pill Tag (Visual Design):
Render a horizontal **pill-shaped tag** with the following specifications:

1. **Positioning**:
   - Fixed in the **bottom-right corner** of the image
   - Must have equal padding from bottom and right edges: approximately **40px** margin from each side (or ~3.1% of width/height)
   - The pill must not touch any image edges

2. **Background**:
   - Color: **semi-transparent black**, `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)`
   - Shape: fully rounded **capsule**, using `border-radius: 999px`
   - Apply a **single soft drop shadow** around the entire pill (not on the text), e.g. `0px 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`

3. **Padding and Layout**:
   - Internal horizontal padding: **18px left and right**
   - Internal vertical padding: **10px top and bottom**
   - Space between icon and text: **10‚Äì12px**

üîπ Icon:
- Place a **sparkle-style icon** to the far left of the pill (vertically centered with the text block)
- Use the `sparkles` icon from the **Lucide Icons** set
- Icon color: **solid blue** `#1553ec`
- Icon size: proportional to the text height (~24px), no stroke or blur

---

üîπ Text (Typography):
- Use **Helvetica Neue** or the closest available sans-serif fallback
- Text block must be **left-aligned**, not centered
- Display as two lines:
   - **First line (bold):** `Imagen generada por IA.`
   - **Second line (regular):** `Revisa fotos reales.`
- Font size: scale proportionally with image height so it is **highly readable**, roughly:
   - First line: `font-weight: 700`, size ~20‚Äì22px
   - Second line: `font-weight: 400`, size ~18‚Äì20px
- Ensure both lines are aligned to the left, and vertically centered within the height of the pill

üîπ Functional Rules:
- This pill-style disclaimer is only rendered when the user clicks ‚ÄúDownload with AI disclaimer‚Äù
- The normal ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button continues returning the full-size, unedited image
- Apply all changes **exclusively on the Car Creation page**

This component should feel native to the platform‚Äôs UI ‚Äî clean, modern, balanced, and visually trustworthy.
