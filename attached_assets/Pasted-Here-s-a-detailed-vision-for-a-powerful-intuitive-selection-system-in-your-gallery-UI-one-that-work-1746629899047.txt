Here’s a detailed vision for a powerful, intuitive selection system in your gallery UI—one that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile, scales from single-click to bulk operations, and gives users clear feedback at every step:

1. Entry & Visual Cues
Hover-to-Reveal Checkboxes
Each thumbnail card shows a faint checkbox overlay (top-left corner) only on hover (desktop) or on tap (mobile), keeping the grid clean until selection mode is needed.

Selection Mode Toggle
A “Select” button in the header enters full-blown multi-select mode: all checkboxes become permanently visible, and the rest of the UI (search, filters) dims slightly to focus on selection.

Selected-State Styling

Checked cards get a 3px accent border (e.g. your brand’s primary color) and a subtle 5% dark overlay.

A small badge in the corner shows the selection index when ordering matters (e.g. for drag-and-drop arrangement).

2. Single, Multi, and Range Selection
Click / Tap

Single: Click/tap checkbox or card to toggle that item.

Mobile: Long-press on a card to toggle its checkbox without entering selection mode; subsequent taps will toggle more.

Keyboard Shortcuts (Desktop)

Arrow keys to navigate focus between thumbnails.

Space toggles selection of the focused card.

Ctrl/Cmd + A selects all in current filter/view.

Esc clears all selections and exits selection mode.

Shift-Click Range

In selection mode, Shift+click on a second thumbnail selects the entire contiguous range between the last selected and this one—ideal for grabbing large blocks in your grid.

Marquee / Lasso Tool

A “Box Select” button lets users drag a marquee over multiple thumbnails to select everything within. On mobile, two-finger drag could achieve similar marquee selection.

3. Bulk Actions Toolbar
Once one or more items are selected, a sticky toolbar appears at the bottom (or floating at top on mobile) showing:

Count of Selected Items
“5 / 120 images selected”

Primary Actions

Download (bulk ZIP)

Delete (with confirmation)

Add to Album / Tag

Secondary Actions

Invert Selection (select all unselected, deselect the current)

Clear Selection

Contextual Dropdown
If some images share metadata (same date, same prompt), allow a “Filter to Selection” that re-filters gallery to show only those selected.

4. Feedback & Progress
Real-Time Updates
If images are being generated or loading as part of the gallery feed, selection should gracefully carry over new inserts: newly arrived items respect existing checkboxes (e.g. if “Select All” was active, they auto-select).

Loading Skeletons & Disabled Controls
While the gallery is fetching more thumbnails, greyed-out placeholders appear; selecting on a placeholder is disabled, avoiding confusion.

Undo Stack
After a bulk action (like delete), show an “Undo” toast (“5 images deleted. [Undo]”) that repopulates the selection if clicked within 5 seconds.

5. Accessibility & ARIA
Each thumbnail is a focusable button or checkbox role, with aria-checked, aria-label="Image generated on 2025-05-06, prompt: '…'".

The marquee tool and range-select announce how many items will be selected upon release.

Bulk toolbar has role="toolbar" and uses aria-live="polite" to announce changes in selected count.

6. Responsive & Performance Considerations
Virtualized Grid
For very large galleries, only render visible rows plus a small buffer, ensuring selection state stays in a lightweight map rather than DOM-attached.

Adaptive Layout
On narrow viewports, the toolbar becomes a bottom-drawer; on touch devices, checkboxes appear on tap and there’s haptic feedback where available.

Persisted Selection State
If the user navigates away and returns (or refreshes), temporarily preserve their selection in local storage, so they don’t lose work.

By combining hover-revealed checkboxes, click‐shift‐range, marquee tools, keyboard support, and a clear bulk‐actions toolbar—along with solid accessibility and responsive behavior—you’ll give users a selection system that’s both powerful and entirely intuitive.
