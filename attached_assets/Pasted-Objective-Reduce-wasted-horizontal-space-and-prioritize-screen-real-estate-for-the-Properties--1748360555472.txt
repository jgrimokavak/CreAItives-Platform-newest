Objective:  
Reduce wasted horizontal space and prioritize screen real estate for the **Properties panel**, making it easier to use on large screens without compromising content readability.

---

1. Properties Panel Prioritization
- Increase the **width** of the Properties panel to approx **30–35%** of the screen on large breakpoints (≥1280px).
- This panel contains the most controls and benefits from more space—give it clear visual dominance when editing.

---

2. Center Panel Optimization (Email Builder)
- The **Email Builder** panel should adapt to the content (email) and **not stretch** wider than **max-width: 600px**.
- Keep the email preview **centered** in its panel using flexbox.
- The column containing the Email Builder can be flexible, but the actual canvas inside it must not exceed 600px.

---

3. Tools Panel Sizing
- Set the **Tools** panel width to a fixed or max of **20%** on large screens.
- Prevent it from shrinking too much on smaller breakpoints, but it doesn’t need to compete with Properties or Builder space.

---

4. Remove Excess Gaps
- Audit `gap`, `px`, and `space-x-*` utilities and **remove any unnecessary padding or margins** around the builder area.
- Eliminate “empty buffer zones” between columns unless essential for visual clarity.

---

5. Visual Anchoring
- Keep all columns vertically aligned using consistent flex layouts.
- Ensure header, tools, and properties panel align cleanly from top to bottom.

Testing:
✔ Properties panel feels roomy and usable on large screens.  
✔ Email preview is centered and capped at 600px.  
✔ Tools panel remains functional without dominating space.  
✔ No horizontal space is wasted across 1440px+ widths.  
✔ Layout adapts cleanly down to tablet breakpoint without overflow.

Constraints:
- Maintain mobile responsiveness  
- Don’t hardcode column widths—use `%` or utility classes (e.g. `basis-1/4`, `xl:w-[420px]`)  
- Layout must scale fluidly between breakpoints
