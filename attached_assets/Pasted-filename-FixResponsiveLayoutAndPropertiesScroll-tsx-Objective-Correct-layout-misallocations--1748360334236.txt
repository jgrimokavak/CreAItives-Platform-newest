Objective:  
Correct layout misallocations from the last implementation. The current setup is wasting horizontal space and the Properties panel still doesn’t scroll independently.

---

1. Properties Panel Scroll — NOT WORKING  
- The Properties panel still doesn’t scroll independently.
- Fix this by:
  • Setting the panel container to `overflow-y-auto`  
  • Wrapping it in a parent with `height: 100vh` or `calc(100vh - headerHeight)`  
  • Ensuring the internal content can scroll while the top stays anchored  
- Validate it scrolls independently from the preview panel on all breakpoints.

2. Layout Allocation — Adjust Column Priorities
- The Tools column is too narrow, and the Email Builder column is too wide, wasting screen real estate.  
- Correct column distribution:
  • `Tools panel`: ~20% width  
  • `Email Builder`: Fixed at **max-width: 600px** centered — the email content shouldn’t stretch  
  • `Properties panel`: ~25–30% width — use extra space to make it more usable

- Remove any hard-coded `col-span-*` that forces the Email Builder to stretch unnecessarily.
- Center the email preview inside the Email Builder panel — allow the containing column to be flexible, but the actual email canvas should remain 600px max.

3. Gap & Alignment
- Maintain horizontal padding (`gap-8`, `px-8`, etc.) only where it improves readability.
- Do not let empty whitespace dominate visual layout on large screens.

Testing:
✔ Properties panel scrolls independently from the rest  
✔ Email canvas is always centered and max 600px wide  
✔ Properties panel is easier to use on large screens  
✔ Tools panel remains functional and readable  
✔ No space is wasted or misallocated across 1440–1920px widths

Constraints:
- Maintain full mobile responsiveness  
- Don’t hardcode pixel values outside the email canvas  
- Respect content density, don't introduce excessive whitespace
