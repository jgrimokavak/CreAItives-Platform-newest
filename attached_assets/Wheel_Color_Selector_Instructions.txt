Task: Add Wheel Color Selector to Car Creator (Single-Car Mode Only)

Objective

Add a wheel-color chooser under the “Appearance” section, directly below the “car color” dropdown. This chooser must be:

- A dropdown menu with the following exact options:
  - silver  
  - black  
  - dark-grey  
  - light-grey  
  - white  
  - chrome  
  - bronze  
  - gunmetal  
  - anthracite  
  - polished-aluminum  
- The default selected value must be silver.
- A circular swatch must be displayed next to the dropdown, showing the currently selected color. This swatch must update dynamically with the selected option.

The selected color value should be saved as a new variable called {{wheel_color}}.

Prompt Integration (Single Car Generation Only)

In the single car generation flow (do not touch batch generation), update the prompt exactly as described below. Use this exact prompt text—do not modify or reformat it in any way.

Original Prompt:
A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of a {{year}} {{make}} {{model}} {{body_style}} {{trim}} in metallic {{color}} paint with subtle micro-reflections. The vehicle is positioned at a precise 35-degree angle showing the front grille, headlights with signature lighting illuminated, and right side profile. Premium tinted windows reflect ambient studio lighting. The car sits on low-profile performance tires with detailed alloy wheels showing brake components behind the spokes. Shot on a polished circular dark charcoal gray studio floor that subtly reflects the vehicle's undercarriage and creates natural graduated shadows. Clean matte white seamless backdrop curves smoothly from floor to wall. Professional three-point lighting setup with key light, fill light, and rim lighting creates dimensional depth while preserving paint reflections and surface textures. Black front license plate features the 'kavak' logo in white. Camera positioned at chest height with slight downward angle. Sharp focus throughout with shallow depth of field on background edges. Commercial automotive photography quality with color-accurate rendering and professional retouching standards.
