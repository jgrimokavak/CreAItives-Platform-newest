Please apply the following corrections to the AI disclaimer tag rendered on image downloads (with disclaimer) for the Car Creation page. These fixes ensure the design exactly matches the intended visual spec.

---

🔧 1. Text Line Spacing (critical):
- The **vertical spacing between the two lines** is currently too large.
- Set **line-height to 1.15 or 1.2 max**
- The gap between "Imagen generada por IA." and "Revisa fotos reales." should be no more than **6–8px visually**
- The two lines must feel like a cohesive unit — not two detached blocks

---

🎯 2. Icon Alignment and Size:
- The **Lucide "sparkles" icon** is currently **too small**
- Increase its size so it matches the **cap height** of the first (bold) text line
- Make sure the icon is **vertically centered relative to the two text lines combined**, not just the top line
- Add horizontal spacing between icon and text: **12–14px**

---

🧱 3. Font Size:
- Increase font sizes slightly for more presence and alignment with design intent:
  - First line: bold, **~28px**
  - Second line: regular, **~24px**
- Use **Helvetica Neue**, or the cleanest fallback sans-serif

---

🧩 4. Pill Width & Padding:
- The pill currently has too much horizontal slack
- Set the pill’s width to **wrap tightly to its content** (icon + text + padding only)
- Adjust internal padding:
  - Horizontal: **18px left/right**
  - Vertical: **10–12px top/bottom**

---

🌑 5. Background & Shadow:
- Background: keep `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)`
- Border-radius: `999px` for full pill shape
- Shadow: **soft global shadow around the entire pill only**, not on text or icon
  - Example: `0px 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`

---

📍 6. Placement:
- The entire tag must be placed in the **bottom-right corner** of the image
- Use **equal margin from right and bottom** edges (e.g. ~40px)

---

📐 7. Output Dimensions:
- Maintain final image size of **1280 × 748 pixels**
- Do not reduce resolution or compress output
