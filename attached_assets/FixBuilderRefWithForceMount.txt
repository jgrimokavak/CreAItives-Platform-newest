Add the `forceMount` prop to the builder tab so the builder DOM is always present, even when the preview tab is open.
Update the builder tabâ€™s code from:

<TabsContent value="builder" className="mt-6">
  {/* builder content */}
</TabsContent>

to:

<TabsContent value="builder" forceMount className="mt-6">
  {/* builder content */}
</TabsContent>

This ensures that `builderRef.current` is always available for export and preview, fixing the empty file issue.
