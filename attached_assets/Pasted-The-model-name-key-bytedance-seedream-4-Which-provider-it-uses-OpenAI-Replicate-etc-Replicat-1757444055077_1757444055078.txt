Any special UI requirements: 
- even though the model allows for custom "width" and "height" i think we can omit it that means also removing the "custom" option from the "size" parameter
- for the "sequential_image_generation" option, please clarify what it is for.
- make sure to use appropriate UI components for each of the parameters in the schema.

Model description: "Seedream 4.0
Seedream 4.0 is ByteDance’s next-generation image creation model that combines text-to-image generation and image editing into a single architecture. It offers fast, high-resolution image generation, rich prompt understanding, and support for multi-reference and batch workflows.

Key Features
Unified generation & editing
Both text-to-image creation and image modifications (e.g. removing or replacing objects) are handled in one model—no need for separate tools.

High-resolution and fast inference
Produces outputs up to 4K with significantly faster inference than prior versions.

Batch and multi-reference support
Accepts multiple reference images and returns multiple outputs in one request.

Natural-language prompt editing
Make precise edits using simple language, like “Remove the boy in this picture” or “Replace this dog with a Schnauzer.”

Versatile style transfer
Apply diverse visual styles such as watercolor, cyberpunk, or architectural to inputs or prompts.

Knowledge-driven generation
Capable of complex content like educational illustrations, charts, timelines, or annotated scenes, with strong reasoning and prompt-following abilities.

Use Cases
Scenario	Example
Creative agencies / designers	Generate batches of concept art or storyboards from multi-image inputs.
Illustration & education	Produce accurate diagrams or timelines with labeled details.
Visual editing & prototyping	Modify photos or designs via text prompts for fast iteration."
