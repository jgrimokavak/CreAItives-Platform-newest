We are replacing the canvas-rendered disclaimer badge with pre-rendered transparent PNG overlays.

This change applies exclusively to the ‚ÄúDownload with AI disclaimer‚Äù action in the Car Creation page.

Do not use any of the old canvas-based disclaimer logic from now on. That includes:
- Rendering text with ctx.fillText
- Manually calculating line height, icon positioning, font sizes, or dynamic widths
- Drawing icons from the Lucide library
- Constructing the pill with canvas shapes, paths, or measurements

---

‚úÖ NEW SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Instead of building the pill dynamically, we are now baking the design into **final PNGs**. These contain:
- Icon
- Text in two lines
- Proper font, spacing, weight, and padding
- Rounded shape and shadow
- Transparent background

The PNGs are all complete visual assets ‚Äî no additional drawing logic is needed beyond positioning them on top of the generated image.

üìÅ FILES TO USE

You must use the following files based on the region or language of the request:

| Language | Filename              |
|----------|------------------------|
| English  | `ai_disclaimer_en.png` |
| Spanish (Mexico) | `ai_disclaimer_mx.png` |
| Spanish (Argentina) | `ai_disclaimer_ar.png` |
| Spanish (Chile) | `ai_disclaimer_cl.png` |
| Portuguese (Brazil) | `ai_disclaimer_br.png` |

üñº IMAGE SPECS

The final image (with disclaimer applied) is always:
- **Canvas size**: `1280 √ó 748 px`
- **Base image**: The AI-generated vehicle image, already center-cropped

Each pill PNG has its own fixed size:
- `ai_disclaimer_en.png`: `887 √ó 319 px`
- `ai_disclaimer_mx.png`: `992 √ó 319 px`
- `ai_disclaimer_ar.png`: `992 √ó 319 px`
- `ai_disclaimer_br.png`: `957 √ó 319 px`
- `ai_disclaimer_cl.png`: `992 √ó 319 px`

These sizes are intentional ‚Äî they already account for padding, layout, and proportions.

üìå PLACEMENT RULES

- Do not resize, scale, or stretch any PNG.
- Always render the pill **at native resolution**.
- The PNG should be anchored to the **bottom-right corner** of the canvas with:
  - **64px margin from the right**
  - **64px margin from the bottom**
- This offset assumes the PNGs are designed at 2√ó scale (for Retina clarity). The padding visually aligns with 32px at 1√ó.

---

üì∏ EXPORT RULE

The final image (with pill) should still be exported as:
- JPEG
- 85% quality (`canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.85)`)

---

‚úÖ This new system guarantees pixel-perfect design in every language and removes all layout inconsistencies.

Only render the corresponding pill overlay based on language/region. Do not fallback to canvas or generate any dynamic visual disclaimers anymore.

Let me know if anything is unclear or if you need help mapping region selection to file name.
