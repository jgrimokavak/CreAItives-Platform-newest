Task: Add 'Adventure Cladding' Toggle to Car Creator (Single-Car Mode Only)

Objective

Add a toggle switch under the “Appearance” section, directly beneath the existing wheel color chooser.

Toggle Specification:

- **Internal variable name:** has_adventure_cladding
- **Label on UI:** “Add Adventure Cladding”
- **Default value:** false
- **Tooltip or subtext:** “Applies thick matte-black plastic cladding around the bumpers, wheel arches, rocker panels, and lower doors for a rugged, off-road look.”

Functionality:

If the toggle is enabled (true), inject the following sentence at the **very end** of the final prompt string (single-car generation only, not batch):

Equipped with an adventure-spec matte-black composite cladding package fully integrated into the front fascia, wheel arches, rocker panels, and lower door sections—including fog-lamp bezels and lower grille inserts in rugged textured finish—creating a sharply segmented two-tone look that visually dominates the vehicle’s entire lower body.

Prompt Integration Rules:

- Only apply this sentence if `has_adventure_cladding === true`
- Always append it to the end of the prompt, after all existing content
- Do not alter existing prompt structure, punctuation, or variables
- Do not apply to batch generation

This task only applies to single image generation mode.
