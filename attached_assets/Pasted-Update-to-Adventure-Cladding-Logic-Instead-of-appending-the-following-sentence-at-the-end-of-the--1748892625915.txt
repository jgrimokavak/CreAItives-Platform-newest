Update to Adventure Cladding Logic

Instead of appending the following sentence at the end of the prompt:

"Equipped with an adventure-spec matte-black composite cladding package fully integrated into the front fascia, wheel arches, rocker panels, and lower door sections—including fog-lamp bezels and lower grille inserts in rugged textured finish—creating a sharply segmented two-tone look that visually dominates the vehicle’s entire lower body."

—you must now inject it **immediately after the phrase**:

"with {{wheel_color}} alloy wheels."

So the final prompt should read exactly as follows when the toggle is enabled:

A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of a {{year}} {{make}} {{model}} {{body_style}} {{trim}} in metallic {{color}} paint with subtle micro-reflections with {{wheel_color}} alloy wheels. Equipped with an adventure-spec matte-black composite cladding package fully integrated into the front fascia, wheel arches, rocker panels, and lower door sections—including fog-lamp bezels and lower grille inserts in rugged textured finish—creating a sharply segmented two-tone look that visually dominates the vehicle’s entire lower body. The vehicle is positioned at a precise 35-degree angle showing the front grille, headlights with signature lighting illuminated, and right side profile. Premium tinted windows reflect ambient studio lighting. The car sits on low-profile performance tires with detailed alloy wheels showing brake components behind the spokes. Shot on a polished circular dark charcoal gray studio floor that subtly reflects the vehicle's undercarriage and creates natural graduated shadows. Clean matte white seamless backdrop curves smoothly from floor to wall. Professional three-point lighting setup with key light, fill light, and rim lighting creates dimensional depth while preserving paint reflections and surface textures. Black front license plate features the 'kavak' logo in white. Camera positioned at chest height with slight downward angle. Sharp focus throughout with shallow depth of field on background edges. Commercial automotive photography quality with color-accurate rendering and professional retouching standards.

Do not modify the rest of the prompt structure, variable names, punctuation, or formatting. This logic only applies in single-car generation mode. Do not touch batch generation logic.
