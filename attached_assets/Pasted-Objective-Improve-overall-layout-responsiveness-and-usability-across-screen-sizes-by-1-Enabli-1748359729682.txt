Objective:  
Improve overall layout responsiveness and usability across screen sizes by:
1) Enabling independent scroll behavior in the properties panel  
2) Ensuring full-height responsiveness  
3) Expanding and optimizing layout on large screens for better use of horizontal space

PART 1 — Properties Panel Scroll & Responsiveness

1. Independent Scrolling  
- The **Properties panel** must scroll independently from the canvas/preview panel.
- Add a vertical scrollbar to the properties panel container.
- Ensure scrolling the property controls does **not** affect the preview panel.

2. Full-Height Panel  
- Set the Properties panel container height to `100vh` (full viewport height).
- Ensure it adjusts fluidly to different screen sizes with no clipping or overflow.

3. Mobile/Tablet Behavior  
- Layout must degrade gracefully on smaller screens (responsive fallback required).
- The scroll behavior and full-height constraint must remain functional across breakpoints.

PART 2 — Layout Expansion for Larger Screens

1. Expand Max Width  
- Increase the `max-width` of the main layout container (`builderWrapper`, `mainLayout`, etc.) to `1440px` or `1600px`.
- Use `margin: 0 auto` to center the layout on widescreens.

2. Internal Column Widths  
- Redistribute column widths:
  • `Email Builder` center panel: expand to 50–60% width  
  • `Properties` and `Tools` side panels: expand to ~20–25% each, if space allows

3. Add Horizontal Padding / Gaps  
- On screens `min-width: 1280px`, add:
  • `gap: 24px` between layout columns  
  • `padding-inline: 32px` to prevent edge hugging

4. Responsive Breakpoints  
- Use `@media (min-width: 1280px)`:
  • Slightly increase font sizes, slider widths, button paddings  
  • Optimize UI density for large monitors without stretching content too far

Testing:
✔ Properties panel scrolls independently with no layout shifts  
✔ Panel always fits the full viewport height (no clipping)  
✔ Layout feels balanced on 1440px and 1920px screens  
✔ No element exceeds readability bounds  
✔ Responsive behavior is preserved down to mobile

Reminders & Constraints:
- Do NOT break tablet or mobile layouts  
- Fixed-position UI (nav, sidebar) must remain visually anchored  
- Keep spacing, max-width rules consistent across all app sections  
- Use fluid units and avoid hardcoded pixel widths where possible
