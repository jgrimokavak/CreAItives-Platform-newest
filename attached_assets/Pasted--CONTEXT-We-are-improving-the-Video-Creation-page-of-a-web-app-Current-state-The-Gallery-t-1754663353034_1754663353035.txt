# CONTEXT
We are improving the **Video Creation** page of a web app.
Current state:
The Gallery tab now displays videos grouped into collapsible sections:
One section per project
One “Unassigned” section for videos with no project
Each group uses the `VideoCard` component for consistent UI and inline playback.
Delete and Move actions work via the context menu on `VideoCard`.
The `/api/video/:id/move` endpoint updates a video’s `projectId`.
Goal for this step:
Add **drag-and-drop** functionality to move videos between groups (projects or Unassigned) with optimistic UI updates.
---
# BEFORE STARTING
Run type-check and start the dev server. 
   Fix any errors from the current code before continuing.
Verify:
`/api/video/:id/move` works by testing the “Move to…” menu on a `VideoCard`.
The Gallery grouping logic is stable and doesn’t break when state updates.

# TASK: Add drag-and-drop between project groups in the Gallery
## 1. Install dependencies
Install the DnD Kit packages:
```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable
Set up DnD context
In function VideoGallery():
	•	Wrap the gallery content in a <DndContext> from @dnd-kit/core.
	•	Inside, use SortableContext from @dnd-kit/sortable for each group.
Make groups droppable
	•	Treat each group (project or Unassigned) as a Droppable area with a unique ID:
	•	Use the project’s id for project groups
	•	Use 'unassigned' for the Unassigned group
Make videos draggable
	•	Wrap each VideoCard in a draggable item using DnD Kit’s useDraggable.
	•	Use the video’s id as the draggable ID.
Handle drops
	•	On drop:
	•	Determine the target group ID.
	•	Compute newProjectId:
	•	null if target group is 'unassigned'
	•	The project’s ID otherwise
	•	Optimistically update local state to move the video to the target group immediately.
	•	Call:
await fetch(`/api/video/${videoId}/move`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ projectId: newProjectId }),
});
	•	On success: Invalidate these queries:
	•	['/api/video']
	•	['/api/projects']
	•	['/api/projects', oldProjectId, 'details']
	•	['/api/projects', newProjectId, 'details']
	•	On failure: Revert the optimistic update and show an error toast.
Keep menu fallback
	•	Keep the existing “Move to…” context menu on VideoCard so users who can’t drag can still move videos.
⸻
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
	•	User can drag a video from one group to another in the Gallery.
	•	The UI updates immediately without waiting for the server (optimistic update).
	•	On refresh, the moved video stays in its new group.
	•	Moving to Unassigned works the same way as moving to a project.
	•	Context menu “Move to…” continues to work as a fallback.
