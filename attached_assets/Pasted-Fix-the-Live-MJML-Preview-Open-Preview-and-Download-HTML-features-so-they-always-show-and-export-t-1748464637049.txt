Fix the Live MJML Preview, Open Preview, and Download HTML features so they always show and export the correct compiled MJML HTML.

1. **Live MJML Preview (Highest Priority)**
   - The MJML preview must always show the latest compiled HTML output below the builder.
   - Diagnose and resolve the backend MJML compilation: If the current server implementation uses mjml-browser (which requires a DOM and fails in Node.js), replace it with the standard mjml npm package, which works in a Node server environment.
   - The /api/email/compile-mjml endpoint must always return valid compiled HTML. Log and handle all errors; never send blank or malformed HTML to the client.
   - On the frontend, make sure the React state (mjmlPreviewHtml) is set to the returned HTML and injected with dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
   - If there are any errors or warnings in the MJML compilation process, display a clear error in the preview area (not just a blank screen).

2. **Open Preview Button**
   - When the user clicks “Open Preview,” open a new browser tab and write the current compiled HTML (mjmlPreviewHtml) into it.
   - The new tab should show the full compiled email, styled and ready for review.

3. **Download HTML Button**
   - When the user clicks “Download HTML,” create a Blob from the current compiled HTML and download it as an .html file.
   - The downloaded file must be a complete, valid HTML document.

4. **General Bulletproofing**
   - Add error logging on both client and server. If MJML compilation fails, show a visible error message in the preview area and do not update with blank HTML.
   - Ensure all network requests succeed and handle 500/server errors gracefully.
   - Do NOT use mjml-browser or any package that requires a browser DOM on the server; use only server-compatible MJML for compilation.
   - Confirm the preview area always receives and displays valid HTML.

After this, the MJML live preview, open preview, and HTML download features must be 100% reliable—always reflecting the current email and never blank or broken.
