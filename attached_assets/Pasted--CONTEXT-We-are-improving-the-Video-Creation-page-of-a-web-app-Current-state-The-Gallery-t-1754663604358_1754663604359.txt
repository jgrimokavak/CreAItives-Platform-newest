# CONTEXT
We are improving the **Video Creation** page of a web app.
Current state:
The Gallery tab displays videos grouped into collapsible sections:
One per project
One “Unassigned” group for videos without a project
Videos are displayed with the `VideoCard` component (inline playback, Delete, Move).
Users can move videos between groups using drag-and-drop or the “Move to…” menu.
`/api/video/:id/move` and `/api/video/:id` (delete) endpoints work correctly.
Goal for this step:
Add **filters**, **bulk selection with actions**, and a few **quality-of-life** improvements to the Gallery.
---
# BEFORE STARTING
Run type-check and start the dev server. 
   Fix any errors before continuing.
Verify:
Drag-and-drop is working without breaking inline playback.
“Move to…” menu still works.

# TASK: Add filters, bulk selection, and small UI enhancements to the Gallery
## 1. Filters
Above the collapsible groups in the Gallery:
Add a small filter bar with:
**Status filter**: All / Completed / Processing / Failed
**Date filter**: All / Last 7 days / Last 30 days
**Search box**: Filters videos by matching the search text against the `prompt` (client-side filter for now).
These filters should update the visible videos **client-side** without breaking counts in the headers.
## 2. Bulk selection
Add a **“Select mode”** toggle button in the Gallery header.
When active:
Each `VideoCard` shows a checkbox overlay.
Clicking selects/deselects the video.
Track selected video IDs in component state.
## 3. Bulk actions bar
When in select mode and at least one video is selected, show a floating bar with:
**Move to…** → Choose a project or “Unassigned”:
Loop through selected IDs, calling `PATCH /api/video/:id/move`.
Use optimistic UI for responsiveness.
**Delete** → Loop through selected IDs, calling `DELETE /api/video/:id`.
**Download** → Trigger a blob download for each selected video (sequentially or with a short concurrency limit).
## 4. Quality-of-life improvements
On hover, if `thumbUrl` exists, show a subtle play overlay to indicate inline playback.
When deleting or moving, show a toast with an **Undo** option:
Undo reverts the action **client-side** within 5 seconds.
No server-side undo required for now.
Preserve the current filter and selection state when navigating between tabs.
---
# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Filters work client-side without breaking group headers or counts.
User can select multiple videos and perform bulk Move, Delete, or Download.
Undo toast appears after Delete or Move and restores videos if clicked.
UI feels responsive: optimistic updates for bulk actions, drag-and-drop still works.
