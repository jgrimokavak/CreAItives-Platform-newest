================================

Create a sleek, contemporary Home page for **“CreAItives Platform 2.0.”**  
The page should:

- Serve as the main landing screen, welcoming users with a clean hero section, a bold title, and a concise tagline.
- Visually showcase every key feature of the platform (Create, Car Creation, Gallery, Upscale, Trash, AI Prompt Helper, etc.) so newcomers instantly understand what the product offers.
- Include an auto‑scrolling carousel that pulls and cycles through recent images from the Gallery, adding life and credibility to the landing page.
- Feel modern, attractive, and cohesive with the rest of the site’s design language.

Navigation requirements:

- Add the new Home page to the sidebar as the **first** item—above “Create.”  
- Treat it as a brand‑new route/component; do not fold it into any existing page.

Use your best judgment on additional visual or UX flourishes that elevate the first‑impression experience.
