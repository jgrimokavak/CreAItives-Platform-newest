# GOAL
1) Add a **Job Tray** to the bottom of the **Create** tab so users can queue multiple generations and see live status (pending/processing/completed/failed) without leaving the page. 
2) Fix the **Create** tab layout so the **Project Panel (right column)** does **not** push the **Result** panel down. The right panel should be a tidy, scrollable area within the column. 
3) Keep everything else working exactly as-is (no dependency changes).
# CONTEXT
Page: `client/src/pages/VideoPage.tsx` (Create tab: form on left, project panel on right, Result panel below both).
Videos display with `VideoCard` including poster thumbnails; this should not change.
We want to begin “Power Mode” gradually by making the right column act like a contained panel that can scroll independently on taller lists.
# REQUIREMENTS
## A) Job Tray (bottom of Create tab)
Add a small, sticky **Job Tray** component shown at the **bottom of the Create tab**, below the Result panel.
Behavior:
When `POST /api/video/generate` is called, immediately add a new job to the tray with `id`, `status` (`pending`/`processing` to start), and minimal metadata (prompt/model).
Poll each active job’s status every ~5–8s (or reuse existing status fetch) until it becomes `completed` or `failed`.
For `completed`: show quick actions (Play → focuses the Result card; optional Download).
Allow dismissing completed/failed jobs from the tray.
Implementation notes:
No new dependencies. Basic React state + existing API is fine (fetch `/api/video/:id`).
Keep at most the last ~5 finished jobs visible unless dismissed.
## B) Create tab layout: contain the right panel, don’t push Result down
Current issue: the **Project Panel** overextends vertically and pushes the **Result** panel far down, sometimes leaving an awkward gap between the form and Result.
Target outcome:
The two-column grid remains.
The **right column’s card content** becomes **scrollable inside the column** when it overflows, so the overall grid height is governed by the left column or viewport, not by the right list length.
Acceptable approaches (choose what’s cleanest in this codebase):
Add a responsive **max height** to the right column card (e.g., `max-h-[calc(100vh-<header+tabs+padding>px)]`) with `overflow-auto`.
Or make the right column **`lg:sticky` with a `top` offset** equal to the header/tabs height, and set `max-h` + `overflow-auto` on the card’s content area.
Constraints:
Do **not** change the global layout or tab structure.
Do **not** introduce horizontal scroll.
Preserve the existing spacing rhythm (gaps and padding).
Ensure keyboard accessibility remains good.
# DO NOTS
Do not modify dependencies or package.json.
Do not change Gallery behavior.
Do not refactor routes or schema.
Keep changes focused on `VideoPage.tsx` and a new lightweight `JobTray` component (and any tiny style tweaks/components needed).
# ACCEPTANCE
I can click **Generate** multiple times; each request appears in the **Job Tray** and updates status independently.
When a video completes, I can **play it** directly or jump focus to the Result card.
The **right Project Panel** is scrollable when it has many items and **no longer pushes** the **Result** panel down.
The form + Result stay visually “connected”; no big empty gap between them.
No regressions: VideoCard UI, gallery, bulk move/delete, and create flow still work.
