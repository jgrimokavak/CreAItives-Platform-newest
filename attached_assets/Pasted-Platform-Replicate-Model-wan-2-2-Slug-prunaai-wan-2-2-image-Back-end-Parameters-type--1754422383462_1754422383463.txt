    prompt: "A cinematic, photorealistic medium shot capturing the nostalgic warmth of a mid-2000s indie film. The focus is a cat with a messy cool platinum white fur, looking directly and intently into the camera lens with a knowing smirk, its head is looking up slightly. The cat wears an oversized band t-shirt that says “Wan can do Images\" in huge stylized text over a long-sleeved striped top and simple silver stud earrings. The lighting is soft, golden hour sunlight creating lens flare and illuminating dust motes in the air. The background shows a blurred outdoor urban setting with graffiti-covered walls (the graffiti says “WAN\" in stylized graffiti lettering), rendered with a shallow depth of field. Natural film grain, a warm, slightly muted color palette, and sharp focus on its expressive eyes enhance the intimate, authentic feel",
