# CONTEXT
We are improving the **Video Creation** page of a web app.

Current state:
The page generates videos using `POST /api/video/generate`.
Generated videos are stored in object storage and shown in the Gallery.
Users can select a project before generating a video.
The UI has a generation form and some project-related elements, but the layout is messy.
A new `VideoCard` component exists and is used to display videos in a consistent way with inline playback, Delete, and Move actions.

Goals for this step:
Restructure the **Create** tab into a clean two-column layout (form on the left, project panel on the right).
Ensure that when a project is selected, its videos appear in the right panel and `projectId` is sent when generating a video.
Add a **Result panel** at the bottom to immediately display the most recently generated video.

---

# BEFORE STARTING
Run type-check and start the dev server.  
   If there are errors from the current code, fix them first.
Verify:
`VideoCard` renders without errors wherever videos are shown.
Inline video playback works.
Delete and Move actions are functional.

# TASK: Create a two-column layout in the Create tab and add a Result panel

## 1. Two-column layout
**In** `client/src/pages/VideoPage.tsx`, inside `TabsContent value="create"`:
Use a responsive grid:
**Left column** (lg: span 8):
Keep the existing **generation form** (prompt, model, resolution, duration, AI Enhance, etc.).
Preserve all `react-hook-form` logic.
**Right column** (lg: span 4):
**Project Panel**:
Project selector dropdown (already present).
"New Project" button (already present).
Below that, list videos for the **selected project** using the `VideoCard` component.
If “none” is selected, show Unassigned videos using `VideoCard`.

## 2. Ensure `projectId` is sent when generating
When the user changes the project in the selector:
Store the selected `projectId` in component state.
Include it in the payload for `POST /api/video/generate`:
    ```ts
    { prompt, model, resolution, duration, projectId }
    ```
Allow `null` for the “none” option.

## 3. Bottom Result panel
Add a full-width section **below both columns** titled **“Result”**.
After a successful `POST /api/video/generate`, store the returned video object in a `lastCreatedVideo` state.
Render that video with the `VideoCard` component.
Add a button **“Open in Gallery”** that switches to the Gallery tab (use the existing `Tabs` control to change the active tab).

---

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Desktop: two-column layout (form on left, project panel on right).
Mobile: columns stack vertically.
Generating a video:
Immediately shows it in the bottom Result panel with inline playback.
Also appears in the right Project Panel list.
Switching projects updates the right panel with that project’s videos.
`projectId` is correctly sent and saved with each generated video.
