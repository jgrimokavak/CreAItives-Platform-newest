- **Visuals**: Custom SVG icon system for 12 car angle previews, dynamic color system.
- **Styles**: "Hub" (hyperrealistic studio photography) and "White" (clean isolated renders).
- **Specialized Features**: Car angle selection, wheel color customization, adventure cladding, background environment selection, localized disclaimer overlay system.

#### Email Builder
- **Engine**: MJML for cross-client compatibility.
- **Interface**: Drag & drop using @dnd-kit/core.

#### File Storage & Management
- **Provider**: AWS S3 with presigned URLs for scalable storage of generated content and batch processing files.
- **Gallery**: Real-time image management with WebSocket updates, star/favorite system, trash/restore, advanced search and filtering, bulk operations.

#### Core Architectural Decisions
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe queries and flexible schema management.
- **AI Model Integration**: Multi-provider approach with a unified API layer to reduce vendor lock-in and optimize model selection. Provider adapter pattern enables frictionless model addition:
  - New providers can be added by implementing the BaseProvider interface
  - Models are centrally configured in server/config/models.ts
  - Frontend automatically discovers available models via /api/models endpoint
  - Dynamic form generation based on model schemas
  - Unified image handler routes requests to appropriate providers
- **Email Rendering**: MJML chosen for robust cross-client compatibility.
- **Real-time Updates**: Custom WebSocket implementation for job progress and gallery updates, with session-based authentication for security.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 with presigned URLs for scalable and secure client uploads.
- **Batch Processing**: Queue-based background jobs with polling to handle long-running operations.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

### Complete Backend Performance Optimization Suite âœ…
- **Date**: August 6, 2025
- **Change**: Implemented comprehensive backend performance optimization addressing site performance issues and glitching
- **Details**:
  - **Auto-refresh optimization**: Changed car data refresh from 5-minute intervals to daily refresh, eliminating constant 14,584-entry API calls from Google Sheets
  - **Authentication caching**: Added NodeCache-based user authentication with 5-minute TTL, reducing database calls from 2 per auth request to cached lookups
  - **WebSocket authentication enhancement**: Enhanced WebSocket auth to store user data on connection, eliminating repeated session checks for future event handlers
  - **Verbose logging removal**: Wrapped 210+ console.log statements in production environment checks, focusing on performance-impacting logs that serialize large objects and occur in polling loops
  - **Date caching system**: Implemented dateCache.ts utility to reduce garbage collection pressure from frequent Date object creation (59+ instances), with smart TTL-based caching for timestamps
- **Architecture Impact**: Major reduction in external API calls, database queries, logging overhead, and memory allocation - significantly improved production performance
- **Performance Results**: Application now runs smoothly with 200-400ms response times, stable WebSocket connections, and reduced memory pressure
- **Key Insight**: The 5-minute car data auto-refresh was the primary performance bottleneck, causing constant large dataset API calls and processing

### Download Experience Fix for Windows PC
- **Date**: August 5, 2025
- **Change**: Fixed download issues on Windows PC where share dialogs and file picker were appearing instead of direct downloads
- **Details**:
  - Modified MobileDownloadManager to detect desktop environments and bypass mobile-specific features
  - Desktop/PC now uses traditional download method directly, avoiding Web Share API and File System Access API
  - Removed mobile-specific attributes (target="_blank") for desktop downloads
  - Created simpleDownload.ts utility as an alternative for desktop-first download experiences
- **Architecture Impact**: Downloads now properly differentiate between mobile and desktop platforms
- **Key Insight**: Mobile optimizations were interfering with desktop experience - platform detection now prioritizes appropriate download method
