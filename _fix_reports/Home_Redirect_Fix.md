# Home Redirect Fix - Simplified Solution
Date: 2025-08-18 22:21 UTC

## Problem Identified
- User reported: "https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app" shows white screen
- Root cause: Complex static deployment redirect was unnecessary
- Solution: Simple redirect to existing `/home` page

## Fix Applied
Simplified the redirect logic in `server/index.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Complex redirect to external static deployment
app.get(["/", "/:path(*)"], (req, res, next) => {
  // ... complex logic for STATIC_APP_ORIGIN
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Simple redirect to /home landing page
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  return res.redirect(308, "/home");
});
```

## Why This Works Better
1. **Existing Architecture**: App already has `/home` as the main landing page
2. **Authentication Flow**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/home` anyway
3. **No External Dependencies**: No need for static deployment setup
4. **Immediate Solution**: Works right now without additional configuration

## User Experience
- **Before**: `https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app/` → White screen/404
- **After**: `https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app/` → `308` → `/home` → HomePage component

## HomePage Features
The `/home` route renders the `HomePage` component which includes:
- Platform overview and capabilities
- Sign-in button for unauthenticated users
- Feature cards for different AI tools
- Professional branding with KAVAK logo

## Benefits
- ✅ **Immediate fix** - No deployment configuration needed
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Shows actual content instead of errors
- ✅ **Existing workflow** - Uses app's intended landing page
- ✅ **Authentication ready** - Handles both logged-in and logged-out states
- ✅ **SEO compliant** - 308 permanent redirect preserves rankings

## Testing
- Root path redirect: `200 OK` → `308 Permanent Redirect` → `/home`
- Homepage load: Serves the full HomePage component with navigation
- Authentication flow: Works for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
