# Detected Endpoints - Hotfix Implementation
Date: 2025-08-18 21:38 UTC

## Current Situation Analysis

### API_URL (Current Public URL)
https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app
- Status: Attached to Autoscale deployment
- Problem: Shows API 404 message instead of SPA
- Resolution: Add redirect for non-API paths

### STATIC_URL (Target for SPA)
https://creaitives-platform-2-0-static.replit.app
- Status: Needs to be created from dist/public
- Purpose: Serve the SPA with zero compute cost
- Configuration: SPA rewrite /* → /index.html

## Hotfix Plan
1. Create Static deployment from built assets
2. Wire environment variables for cross-origin setup  
3. Add redirect code to API server
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## URL Flow After Fix
User visits: https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app/
API redirects: 308 → https://creaitives-platform-2-0-static.replit.app/
Static serves: SPA (index.html with embedded API calls back to original URL)
