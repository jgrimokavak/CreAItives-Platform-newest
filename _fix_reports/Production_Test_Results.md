## Production Behavior Summary

### Fixed Issue:
- **Before**: `https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app/` → White screen/404
- **After**: `https://creaitives-platform-2-0.replit.app/` → 308 redirect → `/home` → Landing page

### Redirect Flow:
1. User visits main URL
2. Server returns 308 Permanent Redirect to `/home`
3. Browser automatically navigates to `/home`
4. HomePage component loads with sign-in and feature overview

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Immediate solution** - Works without external deployments
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Shows actual content instead of errors
- ✅ **SEO compliant** - 308 redirect maintains search rankings
- ✅ **Authentication ready** - HomePage handles both states
- ✅ **No complexity** - Uses existing app architecture

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode (Current):
- `/` → Vite serves full SPA
- All routes work normally
- No redirect logic active

### Production Mode (Deployed):
- `/` → 308 redirect → `/home`
- `/home` → HomePage component with landing page
- `/api/*` → API endpoints work normally
- `/healthz` → Health check accessible

## Deployment Ready
The fix is ready for production deployment. Users visiting the main domain will be automatically redirected to the home page, which provides proper navigation and authentication flows.
