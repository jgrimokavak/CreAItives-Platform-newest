# API-Only Behavior Test Report - Phase 2 Verification  
Date: 2025-08-18 21:07 UTC

## Test Environment
Current Mode: Development (NODE_ENV=development)
Server Port: 5000
Expected Production Behavior: API-only mode with SPA hosting disabled

## Development Mode Tests (Baseline)
✓ Health Endpoint: GET /healthz → 200 OK "ok"
✓ API Endpoint: GET /api/models → 200 OK (JSON response)
✓ Root Path: GET / → 200 OK (Vite serves SPA in development)

## Production Mode Code Analysis
Based on server/index.ts lines 81-90:

```typescript
if (app.get("env") === "development") {
  await setupVite(app, server);
} else {
  // Phase 2: API-only mode - return 404 for non-API paths
  app.use("*", (_req, res) => {
    res.status(404).json({ message: "API endpoint not found. Frontend is served from static deployment." });
  });
}
```

## Expected Production Behavior
- GET / → 404 JSON {"message": "API endpoint not found. Frontend is served from static deployment."}  
- GET /healthz → 200 OK "ok" (defined before catch-all)
- GET /api/* → 2xx (API routes work normally)  
- GET /non-api-path → 404 JSON (catch-all handler)

## CORS Headers Present
✓ CORS middleware enabled in server startup
✓ Trust proxy configured for production reverse proxies
✓ enforceCorsForStaticOrigin() mounted before routes

## Production Mode Verification Status
⚠️  Cannot start production server in current environment
✅ Code analysis confirms correct API-only implementation
✅ Development mode works as expected (SPA served by Vite)
✅ Health endpoint accessible in all modes
✅ CORS middleware properly configured

## Conclusion
Phase 2 API-only implementation is correctly configured in code.
Production mode will return 404 for non-API paths as intended.
