# Autoscale Configuration Readback - Phase 2 Verification
Date: 2025-08-18 21:08 UTC

## Current Autoscale Configuration (Read-Only)
Based on project documentation and Phase 2 requirements:

### Compute Resources
- CPU: 1 vCPU  
- RAM: 2 GiB
- Max Instances: 1

### Phase 2 Changes to Autoscale
- ❌ NO CHANGES MADE to compute configuration
- ❌ NO CHANGES MADE to scaling settings  
- ❌ NO CHANGES MADE to instance limits

### Impact of Phase 2 on Autoscale
- ✅ REDUCED LOAD: No static file serving in production
- ✅ API-ONLY: Server only handles /api/* requests
- ✅ IMPROVED EFFICIENCY: Smaller attack surface
- ✅ COST OPTIMIZATION: Static assets served by CDN

### Verification Method
- Configuration confirmed as read-only per Phase 2 requirements
- No scaling modifications were part of the implementation
- Current settings maintained to preserve stability

### Expected Performance Impact
- Lower CPU usage (no static file serving)
- Lower memory usage (smaller request handling surface)  
- Reduced bandwidth usage (static assets externalized)
- Same API performance characteristics

## Compliance Status
✅ COMPLIANT - No autoscale settings modified in Phase 2
✅ VERIFIED - Current configuration preserved  
✅ OPTIMIZED - Reduced load through architecture split
