# Development Mode Sanity Check - Phase 2 Verification
Date: 2025-08-18 21:08 UTC

## Current Development Server Status
✅ Server Status: RUNNING
✅ Port: 5000
✅ Mode: Development (NODE_ENV=development)
✅ Frontend: Served by Vite middleware

## SPA Rendering Test
URL: http://localhost:5000/
Result: ✅ PASS - SPA renders correctly
- HTML content delivered with Vite development scripts
- React application loads
- Service worker registration present
- PWA manifest linked

## API Functionality Test  
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/models
Result: ✅ PASS - API endpoints functional
- Status: 200 OK
- Response: Valid JSON with model configurations
- CORS headers present
- Authentication middleware active

## Development vs Production Behavior
Development Mode (Current):
- ✅ Vite serves SPA at all non-API routes
- ✅ Hot module replacement active  
- ✅ API routes work normally under /api/*
- ✅ CORS permissive (no restrictions)

Production Mode (Expected):
- ❌ No SPA serving (404 for non-API routes)
- ✅ API routes work normally under /api/*  
- ✅ CORS restricted to allowed origins only
- ✅ Static deployment handles frontend

## Phase 2 Implementation Verification
✅ Development workflow PRESERVED
✅ Vite integration unchanged
✅ API routes unaffected
✅ CORS middleware active but permissive in dev
✅ Ready for production deployment split

## Conclusion
Development environment continues to function exactly as before Phase 2.
No regressions detected in development workflow.
